# My Tech stack and tools

In this repository you can find a list of my personal favorite tools, programming languages and frameworks that I would use to build any kind of project.

Some of the tools listed I have a deep working experience like PHP, Symfony and Golang, some others are there mostly from reading blogs and tutorials that made me think it would be a great choice for some type of project, but that I havent the chance yet to work with like Gridsome or Graphql.

## Methodologies and core values

* Agile
* Devops

## Application Development

### Backend

* [PHP 7](http://php.net/) - PHP its one of the most balanced languages in terms of learning curve, features and performance.
